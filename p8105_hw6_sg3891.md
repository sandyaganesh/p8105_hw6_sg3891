## Question 1

Load and clean data for regression analyses. Here, we will convert
numeric to factor variables and check for missing data.

``` r
birthweight = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex),
    babysex = fct_recode(babysex, "male" = '1', "female" = '2')
  )
```

Model with length at birth and gestational age as predictors

``` r
model2 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight)
```

Model with head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions as
predictors

``` r
model3 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = birthweight)
```
